# Pomodoro-Clock-REACT
A 25 + 5 (or otherwise known as a Pomodoro Clock) app.

This was a project set forth by freeCodeCamp and i found that my original solution didn't quite work as intended. I did some research and found a project that solved some of the problems i was facing. 
The logic in this project is largely from that code so it is not quite my own but i will put the code here so i can look back on some of the logic used.

To see a working version of this, please use my CodePen link below:
